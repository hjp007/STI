This is the satellite-terrestrial integrated (STI) dataset generated for intrusion detection under STIN in paper "A Generation-Aided Satellite Terrestrial Integrated Network Intrusion Detection Framework".
It includes eight labels including benign, Signal Disruption, UDP flood, Jamming, DoS, DDoS, Bruteforce, and Infiltration.
Signal Disruption, UDP flood, Jamming are from satellite domains. 
DoS, DDoS, Bruteforce, and Infiltration are from terrestrial domains. 
More instructions are comming soon...
